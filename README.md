Backend for Boilerhunt

## Initial Setup
To start the backend for BoilerHunt, you have to change directories into backend which is located inside of test
```
cd test/backend
```

Afterwards, enter the command
```
npm start
```
This should start the backend server. You will know if the server has successfully connected if it displays "Server is running on port: 4500"
and "MongoDB database connection established successfully"

The BoilerHunt app should run at full capabilities if the backend server has been started successfully.
